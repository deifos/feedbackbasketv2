# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature integrates Google OAuth authentication with the existing login form component using Better Auth. The integration will allow users to sign in with their Google accounts through a single button click, providing a seamless authentication experience that connects to the existing Better Auth setup with Prisma and PostgreSQL.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to sign in with my Google account, so that I can quickly access the application without creating a separate password.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks the "Login with Google" button THEN the system SHALL initiate the Google OAuth flow
2. WHEN the Google OAuth flow completes successfully THEN the system SHALL create or update the user record in the database
3. WHEN authentication is successful THEN the system SHALL redirect the user to the dashboard page
4. IF the Google OAuth flow fails THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message to the user

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the Google sign-in process to be secure and reliable, so that my account information is protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN initiating Google OAuth THEN the system SHALL use secure HTTPS connections
2. WHEN storing user data THEN the system SHALL only store necessary profile information (email, name, profile picture)
3. WHEN handling authentication errors THEN the system SHALL log errors appropriately without exposing sensitive information
4. WHEN a user signs in multiple times THEN the system SHALL update existing user records rather than creating duplicates

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want visual feedback during the authentication process, so that I understand what's happening.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN clicking the Google sign-in button THEN the system SHALL show a loading state
2. WHEN the OAuth process is in progress THEN the system SHALL prevent multiple simultaneous authentication attempts
3. WHEN authentication completes THEN the system SHALL provide clear success feedback before redirecting
4. IF authentication fails THEN the system SHALL display a user-friendly error message

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to be able to navigate to sign-up if I don't have an account, so that I can create a new account.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks "Sign up" link THEN the system SHALL navigate to the sign-up page
2. WHEN on the sign-up page THEN the system SHALL provide the same Google OAuth option
3. WHEN signing up with Google THEN the system SHALL create a new user account with Google profile information
4. WHEN the sign-up process completes THEN the system SHALL redirect to the dashboard page
